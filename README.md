# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, based on features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset is from the famous Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster challenge on Kaggle.  
It contains features like:
- PassengerId
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked
- Survived (Target Variable)

## Process

1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Understanding missing values
   - Checking distributions and correlations

2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Filling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Normalizing numerical features

3. **Model Building**: 
   - Random Forest
   

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix

## How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


**RESULT**

Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score
Random Forest       | 82%      | 0.80      | 0.84   | 0.82
